# EmotionDetector
The final project from Coursera, Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask

In this project, created a fully functional emotion detector using natural language process. Coded the interface with HTML and Javascript, while backend was completed with Python through the Flask framework. 
Based on user entry of any phrase, the response will return the scores for 5 different emotions (angry, disgust, joy, fear, joy, and sadness). Depending on the emotion of the phrase, this web app will convey the dominant emotion of the user's phrase that was entered.
